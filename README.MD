## Tabbed Autotask

A simple Chrome extension to force Autotask to use tabs instead of opening loads of windows *all of the time.*

Also adds in Autotask URLs into the Chrome popup whitelist to stop Livelinks etc from breaking. 

Install it from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autotask-only-with-tabs/onanbpdhdbngpgacgppdggppfpogobdf)
